# PolSciUniMaStyleFile
LaTeX style file to implement the citation style of the Department of Politics, University of Mannheim, which I created for my dissertation. 

In some cases LATEX will not recognize the file makebst.tex in your installation and produces an error when you use the style file. The easiest way to get around this problem is to download the file from the CTAN server and put it into your working directory.
